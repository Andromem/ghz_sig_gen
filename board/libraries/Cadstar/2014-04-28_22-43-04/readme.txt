To import your new library part to CadStar:

Select Cadstar Export check box from the Export Option screen.  Export the
current library.

Note teh directory your files are stored in from the readme file displayed after
the file is run.

Copy from that location the *.lib file that was created to your Cadstar Library
directory.

Start Cadstar Design Editor and select the menu item "Libraries" and sub menu
"PCB Components"

Select "ADd File" and change teh "Component Files" drop down message to be Archive
files.  This should allow you to select a *.cpa file.  Follow directions on screen
from that point forward.  There may be new items that will need to be added automatically.

Next select the menu item Libraries" and sub menu "Schematic Symbols".  From this screen
select the "Add File" button.  In this screen change the "Symbol Files" drop down box
to read "Archive files".  Now select the *.csa file that was created and stored for you.
Again follow any on screen instructions as line widths, fonts etc. may be required to
be automatically added.

Next select the menu item "Libraries" and sub menu "Parts...".  From this form select
the "Files" button on the right.  You should see the new library you have copied from the
export directory into your library directory.  Select this file and push the "Add File"
button.  You may be asked to re-index your library list at this point.
