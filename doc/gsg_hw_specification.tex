\section{Introduction}

The GSG uses the blah multipin molex connector for power and digital I/O.
The GSG primary board contains the AD9914 DDS chip, an ADCLK905 for input clock 
buffering, and connectors for power, control, and RF output for use with the 
Mar-de-lo-Radio.

Connectors are present on the primary board for CLK input, modular power 
modules, as well as a parallel data connector which exposes the full data path 
of the DDS. 

\section{Connectors and Pinouts}
\subsection{Power Connector}
The component boards designed by PA3AKE use an FCI power part.

\subsection{SMA Output Connector} 
The main RF output from the DAC is routed to an edge-mount SMA connector. 
THis is compatible with the jumper wiring of the PA3AKE modules.

\subsection{Optional External Oscillator Input}
An SMA connector is provided on the component side of the primary board 
for providing an external clock signal. The clock signal must have slew rate
