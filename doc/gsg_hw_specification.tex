\section{Introduction}

The Gigahertz Signal Generator (GSG) was born out of a need for a very clean 
local oscillator for an high performance HF radio receiver. This project 
has had a long inception, starting with the discovery of the CDG2000 
transceiver project Martein Bakker, PA3AKE's refined H-Mode Front End.

While Martein had meticulously designed and tested each part of the receiver 
down to the power and audio outputs, he had stopped short of releasing a 
board for the local oscillator. This was due to the fact that the best perfomance 
for full  HF band operation was achieved by a DDS, however the best DDS chips
available at the time (e.g. the AD9910) had issues with amplitude noise.

This project started in 2013 relied on Martein's conclusion that the missing 
DACBP pin was to blame for the poor amplitude noise performance, and began to 
design a local oscillator board around the most recent DDS from Analog Devices, 
the AD9914.

While the AD9914 has only a 12-bit DAC vs. the AD9910's 14-bits, it provides the 
infamous DACBP for decoupling the internal DAC reference to reduce noise, and is able 
to be clocked at nearly 4x the frequency (3.5GHz vs. 1GHz for the AD9910). 

Given those differences, work began to understand the contributing factors to 
best utilize the AD9914 to produce a low phase noise oscillator for use in an 
HF receiver. Finally, I found the Easy-Phi project and designed the new board to 
be Easy-Phi compatible, which also means it contains an Arduino (Due) compatible 
microprocessor.

\subsection{Requirements}
The original requirements are presented in the scope of the PA3AKE HF 
front-end.

With a 9MHz IF, Martein's front-end has such good IM3DR that the local oscillator
phase noise must be less than -151dBc/Hz at 1KHz, and less than -156dBc/Hz at 
10KHz so as to not be the limiting factor in the receivers overall dynamic range.

This is the primary requirement for the local oscillator and therefore this signal 
generator shall meet that requirement:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | c | r |}
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Performance Requirement at 16MHz Output} \\ \hline
Phase Noise @ 1kHz Offset & -151 & dBc/Hz \\ \hline
Phase Noise @ 10kHz Offset & -156 & dBc/Hz \\ \hline
Phase Noise @ 100kHz Offset & -156 & dBc/Hz \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Therefore, if we consider the DDS as a frequency divider of its reference 
clock, then we have the following requirement for the phase noise of the 
reference clock:
\[
  \Lph(f)_{ref} = \Lph(f)_{out} + 20LOG(N)
\]

Where N is the division ratio between the reference clock and output frequency.

Since the higher the reference clock relative to the output frequency the
higher the spur-free dynamic range, we then require a 3.5GHz oscillator 
with 
\begin{align*}  
  \Lph(f)_{ref} &\leq -151 + 20LOG(\frac{3500}{16}) \\
  \Lph(f)_{ref} &\leq -108 dBc/Hz
\end{align*}
at 1kHz offset.


\section{Connectors and Pinouts}
\subsection{Power Connector}
The component boards designed by PA3AKE use an FCI power part.

\subsection{SMA Output Connector} 
The main RF output from the DAC is routed to an edge-mount SMA connector. 
THis is compatible with the jumper wiring of the PA3AKE modules.

\subsection{Optional External Oscillator Input}
An SMA connector is provided on the component side of the primary board 
for providing an external clock signal. The clock signal must have slew rate 
\[
  SR \geq 2\pi f  Vpk
\]
